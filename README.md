# Data-Manipulation-with-Pandas

## Introduction
This Python project demonstrates various data manipulation techniques using the Pandas library. Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library that provides easy-to-use data structures and functions for working with structured data.

## Project Overview
In this project, we explore common data manipulation tasks such as:

- Data Loading: Importing data from various sources (e.g., CSV, Excel, SQL databases).
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicate entries, and inconsistent data.
- Data Transformation: Performing operations like filtering, grouping, and sorting.
- Data Analysis: Extracting insights and summary statistics from the dataset.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install pandas` if you haven't already.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to see the data manipulation techniques in action.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains sample datasets used in the project.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating different data manipulation tasks.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts with code for specific data manipulation operations.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Dependencies
